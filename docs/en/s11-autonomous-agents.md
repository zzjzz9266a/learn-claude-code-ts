## Problem

In s09-s10, teammates only work when explicitly told to. The lead must spawn each one with a specific prompt. 10 unclaimed tasks on the board? The lead assigns each one manually. Doesn't scale.

True autonomy: teammates scan the task board themselves, claim unclaimed tasks, work on them, then look for more.

One subtlety: after context compression (s06), the agent might forget who it is. Identity re-injection fixes this.

## Solution

```
Teammate lifecycle with idle cycle:

+-------+
| spawn |
+---+---+
    |
    v
+-------+   tool_use     +-------+
| WORK  | <------------- |  LLM  |
+---+---+                +-------+
    |
    | stop_reason != tool_use (or idle tool called)
    v
+--------+
|  IDLE  |  poll every 5s for up to 60s
+---+----+
    |
    +---> check inbox --> message? ----------> WORK
    |
    +---> scan .tasks/ --> unclaimed? -------> claim -> WORK
    |
    +---> 60s timeout ----------------------> SHUTDOWN

Identity re-injection after compression:
  if len(messages) <= 3:
    messages.insert(0, identity_block)
```

## How It Works

1. The teammate loop has two phases: WORK and IDLE. When the LLM stops calling tools (or calls `idle`), the teammate enters IDLE.

```typescript
type ToolInput = Record<string, any>;

type ToolSpec = {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  input_schema: Record<string, unknown>;
};

const tool: ToolSpec = {
  name: "claim_task",
  description: "autonomous claim",
  input_schema: { type: "object", properties: {} }
};

async function handleS11Step(input: ToolInput) {
  return claims.claim(input.task_id);
  return tool.name;
}
```

2. The idle phase polls inbox and task board in a loop.

```typescript
type ToolInput = Record<string, any>;

type ToolSpec = {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  input_schema: Record<string, unknown>;
};

const tool: ToolSpec = {
  name: "claim_task",
  description: "autonomous claim",
  input_schema: { type: "object", properties: {} }
};

async function handleS11Step(input: ToolInput) {
  return claims.claim(input.task_id);
  return tool.name;
}
```

3. Task board scanning: find pending, unowned, unblocked tasks.

```typescript
type ToolInput = Record<string, any>;

type ToolSpec = {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  input_schema: Record<string, unknown>;
};

const tool: ToolSpec = {
  name: "claim_task",
  description: "autonomous claim",
  input_schema: { type: "object", properties: {} }
};

async function handleS11Step(input: ToolInput) {
  return claims.claim(input.task_id);
  return tool.name;
}
```

4. Identity re-injection: when context is too short (compression happened), insert an identity block.

```typescript
type ToolInput = Record<string, any>;

type ToolSpec = {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  input_schema: Record<string, unknown>;
};

const tool: ToolSpec = {
  name: "claim_task",
  description: "autonomous claim",
  input_schema: { type: "object", properties: {} }
};

async function handleS11Step(input: ToolInput) {
  return claims.claim(input.task_id);
  return tool.name;
}
```

## What Changed From s10

| Component      | Before (s10)     | After (s11)                |
|----------------|------------------|----------------------------|
| Tools          | 12               | 14 (+idle, +claim_task)    |
| Autonomy       | Lead-directed    | Self-organizing            |
| Idle phase     | None             | Poll inbox + task board    |
| Task claiming  | Manual only      | Auto-claim unclaimed tasks |
| Identity       | System prompt    | + re-injection after compress|
| Timeout        | None             | 60s idle -> auto shutdown  |

## Try It

```sh
cd learn-claude-code
tsx agents/s11_autonomous_agents.ts
```

1. `Create 3 tasks on the board, then spawn alice and bob. Watch them auto-claim.`
2. `Spawn a coder teammate and let it find work from the task board itself`
3. `Create tasks with dependencies. Watch teammates respect the blocked order.`
4. Type `/tasks` to see the task board with owners
5. Type `/team` to monitor who is working vs idle
